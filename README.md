# Statistic data generator

Sometimes the lack of enough data in statistical research can turn into a big problem for scientists. With this microservice that has been created with the FastAPI framework, you can define key statistical parameters and give two columns with an acceptable correlation like what is seen in the real world!     
For example, you can simulate the relationship between **Smoking** (as a cause) and **Dying** (as an effect) or anything else like this. We hope you enjoy it.
